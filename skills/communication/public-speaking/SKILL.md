# Public Speaking for DevRel

Master **public speaking** for developer conferences, meetups, and technical presentations.

## Core Techniques

### The Hook
```
First 30 seconds determine if audience stays engaged:
- Start with a problem statement
- Ask a provocative question
- Share a surprising statistic
- Tell a brief story
```

### Storytelling Structure
```
Setup → Conflict → Resolution → Takeaway

Example:
"We had 10,000 API errors per day..."
"We tried caching, it made it worse..."
"Then we discovered rate limiting patterns..."
"Here's how you can implement it too..."
```

### Rule of Three
- Three main points per talk
- Three examples per concept
- Three takeaways for audience

## Presentation Tips

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PechaKucha** | 20 slides, 20 seconds each |
| **Mind Mapping** | Visual structure for ideas |
| **Contrast** | Before/after, problem/solution |
| **Repetition** | Key phrases for emphasis |

## Handling Q&A

1. **Anticipate Questions**: Prepare for likely queries
2. **Active Listening**: Fully understand before answering
3. **Be Concise**: Don't ramble
4. **Difficult Questions**: "Great question, let me address that..."
5. **Unknown Answers**: "I'll get back to you on that"

## Nervousness Management

- Practice out loud (not just in head)
- Arrive early, check setup
- Have water nearby
- Use speaker notes (not scripts)
- Focus on helping audience, not on yourself

## Talk Types

| Type | Duration | Depth |
|------|----------|-------|
| Lightning | 5 min | One idea |
| Standard | 20-30 min | Full topic |
| Keynote | 45-60 min | Vision + depth |
