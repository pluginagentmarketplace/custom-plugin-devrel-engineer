# Technical Writing for DevRel

Create **clear, effective technical content** for developer audiences.

## Writing Principles

### Clarity First
```
Bad:  "The utilization of the aforementioned methodology..."
Good: "Use this method to..."

Bad:  "It is recommended that developers should..."
Good: "You should..."
```

### Structure for Scanning
```markdown
# Main Topic (H1 - one per page)

Brief intro paragraph explaining what and why.

## Section (H2 - major topics)

One paragraph context.

### Subsection (H3 - specific items)

- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks for examples
- Tables for comparisons
```

## Content Types

| Type | Purpose | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Tutorial** | Teach task | Step-by-step |
| **How-to** | Solve problem | Problem→Solution |
| **Concept** | Explain idea | What→Why→How |
