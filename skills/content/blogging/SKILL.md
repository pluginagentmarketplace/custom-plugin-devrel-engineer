| H1 | One per page, matches title |
| Images | Alt text, compressed |

## Writing Tips

1. **Start with outline** - Structure before prose
2. **Write for skimmers** - Headers, bullets, bold
3. **Show, don't tell** - Code over explanation
4. **Be concise** - Cut ruthlessly
5. **End with action** - What should reader do next
