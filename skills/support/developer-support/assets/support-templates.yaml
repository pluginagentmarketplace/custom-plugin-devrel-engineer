  authentication:
    question: "How do I authenticate with the API?"
    answer: |
      You can authenticate using API keys or OAuth 2.0:

      **API Keys** (for server-to-server)
      ```bash
      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        https://api.example.com/v1/users
      ```

      **OAuth 2.0** (for user data)
      See our [OAuth guide](/docs/oauth) for full implementation.

      **Common Issues:**
      - [401 Unauthorized](/docs/errors#401)
      - [Token expired](/docs/errors#token-expired)

  rate_limits:
    question: "What are the API rate limits?"
    answer: |
      | Plan | Requests/minute | Daily limit |
      |------|-----------------|-------------|
      | Free | 60 | 1,000 |
      | Pro | 600 | 50,000 |
      | Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

      **Handling rate limits:**
      - Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header
      - Implement exponential backoff
      - [See our rate limit guide](/docs/rate-limits)

  error_handling:
    question: "How do I handle errors?"
    answer: |
      All errors return a consistent format:

      ```json
      {
        "error": {
          "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
          "message": "The 'email' field is required",
          "details": { ... }
        }
      }
      ```
