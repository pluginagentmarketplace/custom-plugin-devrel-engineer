# Community Moderation

Implement **fair, consistent moderation** that keeps communities healthy and inclusive.

## Code of Conduct

### Core Principles
```
1. Be respectful and inclusive
2. No harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
3. Keep discussions constructive
4. Respect privacy and confidentiality
5. Follow platform rules
```

### Enforcement Ladder
| Level | Violation | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Minor (off-topic, mild) | Friendly reminder |
| 2 | Moderate (rude, spam) | Warning + delete |
| 3 | Serious (harassment) | Temp ban (1-7 days) |
| 4 | Severe (threats, doxxing) | Permanent ban |

## Moderation Workflow

```
Report → Review → Decide → Act → Document → Follow-up
   ↓        ↓        ↓       ↓        ↓          ↓
 Flag    Context  Policy   Remove   Log      Appeal
 System  Check    Apply    Warn     Event    Process
```

## Conflict Resolution

### De-escalation Steps
1. **Acknowledge**: "I understand you're frustrated"
2. **Separate**: Move to private channel if needed
3. **Listen**: Let both parties share
4. **Find Common Ground**: Focus on shared goals
5. **Resolve**: Propose fair solution

### Difficult Situations

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Heated debate | Cool off period, then mediate |
| Repeated offender | Direct message, clear warning |
| Doxxing/threats | Immediate ban, report to platform |
| Gray area | Team discussion, document decision |
