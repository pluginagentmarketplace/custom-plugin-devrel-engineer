        - "From Zero to Production: Deploying ML Models in 30 Minutes"
      bad:

    example: |
      **Hook:** Your API is slow, and users are leaving. We've been there.

      **Problem:** At [Company], our core API had grown to 50+ endpoints,
      each averaging 2-second response times. User complaints were mounting,
      and our infrastructure costs were spiraling.

      **Solution:** This talk shares the three-phase optimization strategy
      that reduced our P99 latency from 2000ms to 180ms: intelligent caching,
      query optimization, and edge computing deployment.

      **Takeaways:**
      - Identify latency hotspots using distributed tracing
      - Implement tiered caching strategies
      - Deploy compute to the edge for global performance

      **Credibility:** As the lead engineer on this project, I'll share
      real production data and the lessons learned from our failures.
