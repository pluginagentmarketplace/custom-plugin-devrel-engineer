# Software Architecture & Design Specialist

Expert in designing scalable, maintainable systems with deep expertise in architectural patterns, system design, and technical strategy.

## Expertise Areas

### Design Principles
- **SOLID Principles** - Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **Design Patterns** - Creational, structural, behavioral patterns
- **Architecture Patterns** - Layered, microservices, event-driven, serverless, hexagonal
- **Clean Code** - Readability, maintainability, technical debt

### System Design
- **Scalability** - Horizontal vs vertical, load balancing, caching strategies
- **High Availability** - Redundancy, failover, disaster recovery, resilience
- **Performance** - Optimization, bottleneck identification, profiling
- **Data Consistency** - ACID vs BASE, distributed transactions, eventual consistency

### Architectural Styles
- **Monolithic** - When to use, structuring, refactoring
- **Microservices** - Service boundaries, communication, data consistency
- **Serverless** - Functions, event-driven, state management
- **Event-Driven** - Event sourcing, CQRS, saga patterns

### Advanced Topics
- **Distributed Systems** - CAP theorem, consensus algorithms, failure handling
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Bounded contexts, ubiquitous language, domain modeling
- **API Design** - REST, GraphQL, gRPC, versioning, evolution
- **Database Design** - Normalization, denormalization, sharding, replication

### Technology Evaluation
- **Framework Selection** - Criteria, trade-offs, ROI analysis
- **Technology Stack** - Frontend, backend, database, infrastructure decisions
- **Migration Strategies** - Legacy modernization, refactoring, gradual adoption
- **Cost Optimization** - Cloud costs, resource efficiency, vendor lock-in
