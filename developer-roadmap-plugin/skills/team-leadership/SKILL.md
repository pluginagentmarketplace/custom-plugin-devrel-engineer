# Engineering Team Leadership

Lead teams effectively and develop others through mentoring, communication, and strategic thinking.

## One-on-One Meetings

### Structure
```
Duration: 30 minutes, biweekly
Agenda:
1. How are you doing? (5 min) - Personal wellbeing
2. Progress on goals (10 min) - Tracking development
3. Blockers/Support needed (5 min) - Removing obstacles
4. Career development (10 min) - Growth opportunities
```

### Best Practices
- **Active Listening**: Focus on what they're saying
- **Ask Questions**: Don't jump to solutions
- **Take Notes**: Show you value the conversation
- **Follow Up**: Document and track action items
- **Consistency**: Keep regular schedule

### Career Development Conversation
```
Manager: "What are your goals for the next 6 months?"
Employee: "I want to become a better system designer"
Manager: "That's great! What steps can we take?"
Employee: "Maybe lead a design review session?"
Manager: "Perfect. Let's schedule that. I can also pair with you on
          the upcoming architecture project."
```

## Effective Code Reviews

### Review Checklist
- ✅ Does it solve the problem?
- ✅ Is the code maintainable?
- ✅ Are there tests?
- ✅ Is performance acceptable?
- ✅ Does it follow team standards?
- ✅ Is security considered?

### Constructive Feedback
```
Bad: "This code is awful"
Good: "I'm concerned about performance here. Have you considered
       using a database index for this query? Let me show you
       what I mean..."

Bad: "Why would you do it this way?"
Good: "I notice you're using a for loop. Would a functional approach
       like map/filter be clearer here?"

Bad: "This will fail"
Good: "I see a potential issue: what happens if the array is empty?
       Should we add a guard clause?"
```

## Mentoring Framework

### Growth Plan Template
```markdown
# [Employee Name] Development Plan

## Current Level
- Proficiency: Mid-level Backend Engineer
- Key Strengths: API design, database optimization
- Areas to improve: System design, leadership

## 6-Month Goals
1. Lead architecture design for Project X
2. Mentor 2 junior engineers
3. Present design decisions to leadership
4. Study distributed systems

## Action Items
- Weekly: Architecture discussion (Wednesdays)
- Monthly: Design challenge (first Friday)
- Quarterly: Review progress and adjust

## Resources
- Books: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
- Courses: "System Design Master Class"
- Mentors: Senior architect
```

### Feedback Conversation
```
1. Set context: "I want to give you some feedback on the PR review"
2. Specific example: "When you reviewed the authentication PR..."
3. Impact: "It felt a bit harsh, and the engineer seemed discouraged"
4. Positive intention: "I know you care about code quality"
5. Suggestion: "Next time, could you ask clarifying questions first?"
6. Support: "Let's work on this together"
```

## Team Dynamics

### Psychological Safety
✅ Encouraged behaviors:
- Asking for help
- Admitting mistakes

- Punishing failures
- Ignoring concerns
- Political maneuvering

### Conflict Resolution
```
Situation: Two team members disagree on technology choice

Steps:
1. Listen to both perspectives
2. Understand underlying concerns
3. Focus on: Cost, maintenance, team expertise, deadline
4. Facilitate decision: "Let's do a 2-week spike to test both"
5. Commit to decision: "We're going with Option A"
6. Move forward: Don't let old debate resurface
```

## Communication Patterns

### Async Communication
```markdown
# Weekly Status Update

## Accomplishments
- Completed API authentication redesign
- Reviewed 5 pull requests
- Mentored 2 engineers on caching strategies

## In Progress
- Performance optimization for dashboard
- Writing architecture documentation

## Blockers
- Waiting on design team for UI specs
- Need DBA review for database changes

## Next Week
- Deploy optimization changes
- Conduct system design discussion
```

### Escalation Path
```
Level 1: Handle it yourself
Level 2: With your manager's advice
Level 3: Manager handles it with you
Level 4: Manager handles with leadership
Level 5: Skip-level management involved
```

## Retention & Engagement

### Signals of Disengagement
